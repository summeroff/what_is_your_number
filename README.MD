### Brief Overview

Vladimir Putin, a defiant powerbroker in a near-future Moscow, is ambushed by dimension-jumping operatives hunting mysterious "numbers" embedded in his mind—codes tied to a reality-altering Nexus. Raven, a battle-hardened Consortium agent, fails to capture the real Putin, chasing decoys through bloody alternate Moscows, his team torn apart. Sasha Volkov, a reckless civilian, stumbles into Raven’s Transatron, gleefully killing in a “game” she doesn’t know is real, only to be tortured by Liang Wei’s Chinese mercenaries for numbers she doesn’t have. Kessler Hahn, a Consortium enforcer, storms in to clean up, battling Liang’s crew as the rig explodes, leaving him scarred but alive. Putin’s fate hangs, Liang escapes, and the numbers’ secret—power over dimensions—drives a war across realities.

The tale rockets from alley chases to cosmic stakes, blending noir grit, rogue tech, and characters breaking under relentless pressure. What’s next? Dimensional showdowns, fractured factions, and a truth that might shatter them all.
